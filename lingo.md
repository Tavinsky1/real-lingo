    session_id = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    action = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    country = models.CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)
    page_url = models.URLField(blank=True)
    ip_address = models.GenericIPAddressField(null=True, blank=True)
    user_agent = models.TextField(blank=True)
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

# Admin Views in entries/admin_views.py  
def analytics_dashboard_view(request):
    # Comprehensive analytics processing
    # Charts, graphs, and statistics generation
    # Traffic analysis and user behavior insights
```

    feedback_type = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=FEEDBACK_TYPES)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField()
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=STATUS_CHOICES, default='open')
    priority = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=PRIORITY_CHOICES, default='medium')

### Quiz Answer Randomization Fix
**Fixed quiz answer positioning to prevent correct answers from always appearing in the same position.**

#### Problem Identified ❌
- Correct answers consistently appearing as option "B" in quizzes
- Poor randomization affecting quiz difficulty and user experience
- Backend shuffling choices but not updating correct answer index

#### Solution Implemented ✅
```python
# In analytics_views.py - quiz_questions function
choices = [correct_answer] + distractors[:3]
random.shuffle(choices)

# Update correct answer index after shuffling
correct_answer_index = choices.index(correct_answer)

# Pass correct index to frontend
'correct_index': correct_answer_index,
```

```javascript
// In slang_quiz_fixed.html - Frontend processing
this.questions = data.questions.map(q => ({
    question: q.question,
    options: q.choices,
    correct: q.correct_index !== undefined ? q.correct_index : q.choices.indexOf(q.correct_answer),
    explanation: q.explanation || '',
    category: q.category || '',
}));
```

#### Validation ✅
- Tested across multiple quiz sessions
- Correct answers now properly randomized across all option positions (A, B, C, D)
- Maintains quiz integrity while improving user experience

## Latest Issues Resolved

### Quiz Display Issue (Session 1 - Final)
**Problem**: Quiz modal required scrolling to see all content
**Root Cause**: Fixed height containers with overflow and excessive padding
**Solution Implemented**:
- Converted to flexbox layout with `justify-content: space-between`
- Removed `overflow-y: auto` from main container
- Added calculated max-heights: `calc(90vh - 180px)` for quiz body
- Optimized padding and margins across all components
- Implemented responsive height calculations for mobile devices
- Added `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent compression of key elements

**CSS Changes Made**:
```css
.quiz-container {
    max-height: 90vh;
    min-height: 400px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

.quiz-body {
    flex: 1;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-between;
    max-height: calc(90vh - 180px);
}

/* Mobile optimizations */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .quiz-body {
        max-height: calc(95vh - 140px);
    }
}
```

**Validation**: Tested across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports - quiz now displays fully without scrolling on all screen sizes.
