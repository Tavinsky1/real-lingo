2280,rompieron enseguida,"The phrase ""rompieron enseguida"" translates to ""they broke right away"" in English.  The example sentence indicates its use in the context of describing shoddy, quickly-breaking shoes.

2281,birras,"The word ""birras"" is the colloquial plural of ""birra"", meaning ""beer"" in Spanish.  It originates from the Italian word ""birra.""

2282,store,"""Store"" in the context of a nightclub is a youth slang term in Argentina.

The example provided, ""¿Vamos"", which translates to ""Shall we go?"", suggests that 'store' might refer to a place to go, specifically a nightclub."
2295,para ir al centro,"The phrase ""para ir al centro"" translates to ""to go downtown.""  The provided example, ""para ir al centro"" (I'm going to take the bus to go downtown), shows its use within a longer sentence.

The entry lacks sufficient information to classify it as a specific linguistic category beyond a general phrase."
2298,bread),"The term ""bread)"" is a classic example of Lunfardo, a type of slang originating in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  It's often heard in tangos and refers to a bachelor pad or apartment. The example provided, ""(He met his lover in the bachelor pad.)"", illustrates its usage. The parenthesis might indicate a colloquial shortening or informal nature."
2301,bread,"The provided text only gives a fragment of a Lunfardo term.  'Bread' in this context is likely part of a larger expression, given its description as 'classic Lunfardo' and its association with tangos.  Lunfardo is a type of Argentine slang, particularly associated with Buenos Aires. Further context is needed to fully understand the meaning and usage of this incomplete entry. The incompleteness of the entry prevents a full definition."
2308,negociar,"The word ""negociar"" means ""to negotiate"" in standard Spanish.  However, the inclusion of the tags ""lunfardo"" and ""quechua"" suggests that its use in the example sentence, ""(He's very skilled at negotiating.)"", might carry a specific connotation within Argentinian slang, possibly influenced by either lunfardo (Buenos Aires underworld slang) or Quechua (an indigenous language of the Andes).  The exact nuance is not specified in the provided text, but it implies a more informal or idiomatic use than standard Spanish."
2309,"Skilled, expert, smooth operator","This phrase describes someone with significant experience and skill, capable of handling situations effectively and smoothly.  It doesn't represent a specific slang term or idiom unique to Argentina, but rather a general descriptive phrase that could be used in various contexts."
2317,Chambón,"The term ""Chambón"" in Argentinian Spanish is used as slang for ""guy, dude, fellow; girl/woman"".  It's a versatile term applicable to both genders. The entry indicates its origin is from the Spanish word ""chambón"" itself, suggesting a direct derivation and implying its usage is likely informal and colloquial."
2319,creas nada,"The phrase ""creas nada"" literally translates to ""you create nothing.""  However, it's used idiomatically in Argentine Spanish to mean something like ""That guy is a smooth talker, don't believe anything he says.""  It implies that the person is insincere and their words are empty or worthless."
2323,No me vengas con chamuyos,"This phrase translates to ""Don't give me that nonsense.""  'Chamuyos' refers to lies, deception, or nonsense. It's a slang term used to dismiss something considered untrue or irrelevant. The usage implies a degree of informality and possibly frustration."
2329,"Cool, great, awesome, nice","These terms are used informally in Argentina to express approval or admiration for a person or thing.  They are equivalent to the English slang terms 'cool,' 'great,' 'awesome,' and 'nice' and carry a similar informal connotation."
2340,Hoy me toca gapar a mí,"This phrase is a wordplay on the expression ""Hoy me toca pagar a mí"", which means ""It's my turn to pay"".  The word ""pagar"" (to pay) has been replaced with ""gapar"", which is not a standard Spanish word.  The use of ""gapar"" creates a humorous and informal effect, suggesting a playful or slightly mischievous avoidance of the responsibility of paying. The context implies that it's used in a situation where someone is jokingly shirking their responsibility to pay."
2346,guita,"In Argentinan Spanish, ""guita"" is slang for ""money"".  The example sentence shows its informal usage in a common phrase."
2347,Dejate de joder,"This phrase translates literally to ""Stop fucking around"" or ""Stop messing around.""  However, it's a much stronger and more vulgar expression than the literal translation suggests. It's used to express annoyance, frustration, or disbelief at someone's actions or words. The context provided suggests it's used as a dismissive or rude response to a suggestion (going to a party).  The intensity of the insult depends heavily on tone and context, but it's generally considered inappropriate for formal settings."
2350,joda,"In Argentinian youth slang, ""joda"" refers to a party.  The example shows its use in an exclamation, ""¡Vamos a la joda!"" meaning ""Let's go to the party!""  ""Skere"" is another slang term included in the example, but its meaning is not provided."
2353,joya,"The word ""joya"" literally means ""jewel"". In Argentinian Spanish slang, it's used as an informal expression of agreement, approval, or to indicate that something is great, cool, perfect, or okay.  It's a concise way to express positive affirmation."
2373,"No seas ortiba, vení con nosotros.","This is a slang phrase in Argentinian Spanish.  It translates to ""Don't be a killjoy, come with us.""  'Ortiba' is the slang term here, implying someone who spoils the fun or is negative. The use of 'vení' instead of 'ven' is characteristic of the informal 'vos' form common in Argentina."
2379,pibes,"In Argentina, ""pibes"" is a colloquial term for ""kids"" or ""young guys"".  The example sentence shows its usage in a casual context, referring to children playing in a plaza.  It's informal and commonly used among younger generations."
2382,pilcha / pulcha,"The term ""pilcha / pulcha"" refers to clothes, attire, or clothing.  Its origin is Araucano/Mapudungun, an indigenous language of Argentina and Chile.  The entry suggests this term is used as a regional slang term for ""clothes"" in Argentina."
2385,Dame un piolín para atar esto,"This phrase translates to ""Give me a string to tie this.""  The entry lacks sufficient context to determine if 'piolín' is used in a specific slang or idiomatic way in Argentina.  Without further information, it's treated as a general phrase."
2390,Puchu,"The Quechua word ""puchu"" meaning leftover or remainder.  In the context provided, it's used in the phrase ""Dame un puchu"" which translates to ""Give me a cigarette.""

The example shows it used as a request for a cigarette."

2395,Se puso a putear a todo el mundo,"This phrase translates to ""He started cursing everyone out.""  'Putear' is a vulgar verb meaning to curse or swear profusely. The phrase describes someone becoming angry and directing their anger through strong profanity at everyone around them.  The use of 'putear' indicates a strong, informal, and potentially offensive expression common in Argentinian Spanish."
2399,rajar,"The verb ""rajar"" in this context means to fire someone from their job (example 1) or to leave/get out of a place (example 2).  The examples show its informal and colloquial usage.  ""Lo rajaron del laburo"" translates literally to ""They red him from the work,"" but the meaning is clearly dismissal.  ""Rajá de acá"" means ""Get out of here!"" or ""Scram!"""
2408,That video made me,"This is an incomplete entry.  It appears to be the beginning of a sentence expressing a reaction to a video, likely followed by an internet slang term or phrase indicating a strong emotional response (e.g., 'That video made me LOL', 'That video made me cry').  The incompleteness prevents a full definition. The context suggests internet slang usage within the Argentinian Spanish-speaking community."
2411,cringe a lot,"The English phrase ""cringe a lot"" used in Argentina, implying a strong feeling of embarrassment or awkwardness.  The entry suggests it's used frequently by young people and is an internet slang term."

2423,cancelled,"The entry only provides the word ""cancelled"" within quotation marks and the mention of Argentina.  Without further context, it's impossible to definitively determine the meaning or usage of ""cancelled"" in this specific Argentinian context. It could represent a slang term, a cultural reference, or simply a misinterpretation of the word. More information is needed."
2430,Street,"A slang term for ""street"" in Argentinian Spanish. It originates as a reversed spelling of the Spanish word ""calle"" (street).  While understood, it's noted as slang or a less formal alternative."
2443,handle,"The provided text ""(handle). (I'm super hyped"" is insufficient to determine the meaning of ""handle"" within the context of Argentinian Spanish.  It appears to be used as part of a larger expression, possibly an abbreviation or a reference to something else entirely.  The inclusion of ""I'm super hyped"" suggests a positive emotional context, but the meaning of ""handle"" remains unclear without more information."
2450,to the movies?,"The entry only provides a fragment of a conversation in Spanish from Argentina ('es-AR').  The phrase ""to the movies?"" is presented within a context suggesting agreement.  The response ""That works perfectly for me"" implies the question was a suggestion or invitation to go to the movies.  There is no specific slang or idiomatic meaning presented; it's standard conversational English translated into Spanish. The tags suggest youth slang, but the phrase itself is not inherently slangy."
2452,milipilis,"The provided text only gives an example sentence: '(The ""milipilis"" are always at the mall.)'.  This suggests that ""milipilis"" is a slang term, likely used by young people in Argentina, to refer to a group of people, possibly with a pejorative connotation implying they are annoying or bothersome, frequently found at shopping malls.  The exact meaning requires further investigation."
2460,"¡Dale, sacate la gorra y divertite!","This phrase translates roughly to ""Come on, loosen up and have fun!""  It's a colloquial and encouraging expression, particularly used among young people in Argentina.  'Sacate la gorra' literally means 'take off your cap,' implying a release of inhibitions and a more relaxed attitude."
2465,después vamos al boliche,"The phrase ""después vamos al boliche"" translates literally to ""after we go to the bowling alley."" However, in Argentine Spanish, particularly among younger generations, ""boliche"" refers to a nightclub or disco.  The entire phrase implies a plan to pre-party somewhere before heading to a nightclub.  The use of ""boliche"" instead of the more formal ""discoteca"" or ""club"" points to a colloquial and informal setting."
2468,se fueron de joda,"This phrase translates to ""went out partying"" in English.  'Joda' is Argentinian slang for a party or a night out, particularly among young people.  The use of 'pibes' (guys, lads) further emphasizes the youth-oriented nature of the expression. The sentence structure reflects informal conversational style."
2471,"it"" or ""cool""","""It"" or ""cool"" are used as slang terms, popularized by trap music in Argentina.  The entry lacks specific details on nuances of meaning or usage beyond its association with trap music."
2483,Context is key,"This phrase is not specific to any particular region or sub-region within Argentina. It's a common English expression that emphasizes the importance of considering the surrounding circumstances to understand the meaning of something.  It's not slang, jargon, or an idiom specific to Argentina or Spanish, but rather a general maxim applicable across languages and cultures."
2488,No le hagas caso a los haters,"This phrase translates to ""Don't pay attention to the haters.""  It's a common expression used across various Spanish-speaking regions, but the example's language code 'es-AR' indicates its use in Argentina. The phrase reflects a general sentiment of ignoring negative online or social commentary."
2489,"To reduce options, put pressure on someone","This entry describes a metaphorical expression in Argentinian Spanish (es-AR) that signifies the act of limiting someone's choices or applying pressure to influence their decision.  The exact phrasing used in Argentina would need further investigation, as this is a description of the meaning rather than a specific term."
2491,"To hold one's ground, endure pressure",This entry describes a metaphorical expression in Argentinian Spanish (es-AR) meaning to maintain one's position or resolve despite facing difficulties or opposition.  The entry explicitly labels it as jargon.
2516,Incompetent person,"This entry simply labels the term as jargon, indicating it's likely an informal or colloquial way to refer to an incompetent person in Argentina.  No further details on specific usage or cultural context are provided."
2523,Winger; leading team in a league,"In the context of Argentinian Spanish (es-AR), this entry appears to use ""Winger"" in a dual sense.  It refers to both the standard football (soccer) position of a winger and, in a figurative sense, to the team leading the league.  The semicolon suggests a possible colloquial or jargonistic usage where the leading team is metaphorically described as the ""winger"" perhaps implying they are out in front, leading the pack."
2525,ground for talent,"A metaphorical expression used in the context of football (soccer) in Argentina.  It refers to a promising young player or a player with significant potential, implying that they are a fertile ground from which talent will grow."
2532,examen era fácil,"This phrase, ""examen era fácil"" (the exam was easy), is not a slang term or idiom in itself.  The provided context shows it's used within a larger statement expressing disappointment after studying hard for an easy exam.  The meaning is conveyed through the juxtaposition of the effort expended and the unexpectedly easy nature of the exam, implying a sense of wasted effort.  It doesn't represent a specific linguistic feature of Argentine Spanish but rather illustrates a common sentiment."
2535,¡De una!,"This phrase translates to ""From one!"" in a literal sense, but functions as a colloquial affirmation meaning ""For sure,"" ""Definitely,"" or ""Absolutely.""  The example provided shows its use as a concise, enthusiastic response to an invitation.  It's informal and common in Argentina."
2536,De nitely!,"""De nitely!"" is a colloquial and informal way of expressing strong agreement or affirmation in response to a suggestion or question, such as ""Shall we go to the movies?""  The spelling with a space in ""nite"" reflects common informal written style and is not a grammatical error in this context.  The example shows its use in Argentinian Spanish."
2541,la loma del orto,"""on the hill of the ass"".  This is a vulgar colloquialism used in Argentina to refer to a remote or insignificant place. The example sentence ""El pueblo queda en la loma del orto"" translates to ""The town is on the hill of the ass"", implying the town is in a far-off, unimportant, or possibly undesirable location. The phrase's meaning relies heavily on the vulgarity of ""orto"" (ass)."
2547,Babia,"The term 'Babia' refers to a region in Spain.  The entry notes that it is also used in general Spanish, implying a cultural reference rather than a specific Argentine term.  The meaning in this context is likely related to being absent-minded or in a dreamy state, similar to the English expression 'off in Cloud Cuckoo Land'.  The origin note provides the geographical context."
2549,clase,"The word ""clase"" (class) is used idiomatically in the example sentence to refer to the entire duration of a class period.  The sentence ""El estudiante estuvo soñando despierto durante toda la clase."" (The student was daydreaming throughout the whole class) illustrates this usage.  It implies the student was inattentive for the entire class period, not just a specific part of it."
2557,impecable,"In the provided context, ""impecable"" means 'top-notch' or 'flawless'.  It describes something of excellent quality or condition. The example sentence shows its use in describing a hotel. While 'impecable' is a standard Spanish word, its usage in this context within the provided example sentence highlights its idiomatic application to describe overall excellence."
2558,¿Me hacés la gamba y me llevás al...,"This phrase, meaning ""Can you do me a favor and take me downtown?"", uses the slang term ""hacés la gamba.""  'Hacer la gamba' literally translates to 'do the leg' but figuratively means 'do me a favor.' The provided text also mentions that ""gamba"" in older slang could also refer to 100 pesos, suggesting a possible historical evolution of the term's meaning. The context implies a request for a ride downtown, highlighting the informal and colloquial nature of the expression."
2559,centro?,"The phrase ""centro?"" in Argentine Spanish is not a literal question asking ""center?"" but rather an idiomatic request for a favor, specifically to be taken downtown.  It implies a request for a ride or assistance in getting to the city center. The question mark adds a softening effect, making the request less direct and more polite."
2560,100 pesos,"The phrase ""100 pesos"" in the provided context refers to an older slang term, the exact meaning of which is not explicitly defined.  The example sentence suggests it might be a request for a favor, possibly implying a payment or compensation of 100 pesos (in older slang) for the service rendered. The lack of explicit definition makes the precise meaning uncertain, but it's clearly slang related to money and favors."
2561,oneself the rat,"The provided text ""oneself the rat"" is incomplete and lacks context.  It's impossible to determine its meaning, usage, or cultural significance without further information. The fragment suggests a possible metaphorical expression, but its interpretation remains ambiguous."
2565,hacer novillos,"The provided text translates to ""not going to school today, I'm going to play truant.""

2577,Se levantó a la chica más linda de la esta.,"This phrase translates roughly to ""He/She picked up the prettiest girl at the party.""  The provided example shows it used in a context of boasting or recounting a successful social interaction.  The use of ""se levantó"" (literally 'he/she got up') in this context is idiomatic, implying the successful romantic pursuit of a woman.  The shortened ""esta"" likely refers to ""fiesta"" (party), a common colloquial shortening."
2578,To pick someone up,"The phrase ""To pick someone up"" in this context means to successfully flirt with someone or initiate a romantic encounter.  The entry lacks specific details on regional variations within Argentina. The usage implies a colloquial, informal setting."
2579,la chica más linda de la esta,"This phrase, ""la chica más linda de la esta,"" translates to ""the prettiest girl of this place.""

The phrase ""they cancelled my ight"" is likely a misspelling or a colloquial shortening of a longer phrase, possibly related to a plan or event being cancelled. The overall meaning expresses frustration and disappointment at having something ruined.  The lack of clarity makes a precise definition difficult. More context is needed to fully understand the intended idiom."
2595,Are you kidding me? Are you pulling my,"This is an incomplete English phrase.  While understandable in English, it lacks sufficient context to determine its specific meaning or usage within the context of Argentinian Spanish ('es-AR').  The phrase is an expression of disbelief or incredulity.  More of the phrase is needed to determine if it's a direct translation, a common expression in Argentinian English, or something else entirely."

The phrase ""know how much this costs? — Ugh, you got me/I have no idea."" expresses a lack of knowledge about the price of something.  The response ""Ugh, you got me"" or ""I have no idea"" is a colloquial and informal way to admit ignorance. The idiom's meaning is conveyed through the implied context of the question and the informal response."
2601,"for it?, Do you feel like it? (Shall we)","This entry appears to be an incomplete or poorly formatted representation of a phrase used to suggest doing something.  The phrasing ""for it?"" and ""Do you feel like it?"" are attempts to translate a likely informal Argentinian Spanish expression into English. The parenthetical addition of ""Shall we"" further suggests an attempt to clarify the meaning.  Without more context, it's impossible to definitively categorize it or provide a precise definition.  The lack of a single, clear term makes categorization difficult."
2604,"¿Vamos al cine? — Dale, me pinta.","This is an idiomatic expression in Argentine Spanish.  ""¿Vamos al cine?"" means ""Shall we go to the cinema?""  ""Dale"" is an informal affirmative, similar to ""Okay"" or ""Let's do it.""  ""Me pinta"" is the idiomatic part, literally translating to ""it paints me"" or ""it appeals to me.""

2606,me pinta,"""Me pinta"" in Argentinian Spanish slang expresses the feeling of wanting to do something, or being inclined to do something.

2607,beat it!,"While literally meaning to leave quickly, in this context ""beat it!"" appears to be used as an expression of boredom and a desire to end a situation.

Further context is needed to confirm its precise meaning and usage within Argentinian Spanish."
2617,¿Dónde está Juan?,"The phrase ""¿Dónde está Juan?"" (Where is Juan?) is used idiomatically in Argentina, similar to the English idiom ""No idea.""  It expresses a lack of knowledge or understanding, often playfully or sarcastically.  The specific name 'Juan' is not significant; it could be replaced with another common name."
2620,No está bien,"The provided text is a fragment of a sentence, not a complete term or phrase.  It translates to ""It's not appropriate, it's not right, it doesn't work, it's not cool.""  The parenthetical ""(Literally """"it"""")"" suggests that the phrase is an incomplete expression, possibly a starting point for a longer rejection or disapproval statement.  Without more context, it's difficult to definitively categorize it. The lack of a specific term makes it difficult to assign a precise meaning or cultural context."
2632,"To get your act together, to get energized, to start working",This entry describes a concept rather than a specific term or phrase unique to Argentinian Spanish.

In the context of the example provided, ""Me cansé, me tomo el palo"" (I'm tired, I'm outta here), it means to leave, to go away, or to depart.
